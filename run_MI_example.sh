# An example of create MI heatmap for our published CAP-SELEX matrices
# To run this pipeline, you need a batch file with TF_pairs information (File Batch_test is an example)and a folder (e.g. ./SELEX) that stores sequence file
# The sequence files should contain DNA sequence only, not fastq format. And the name of the sequence files should be consistent with the batch file.
# You can take "Batch_test.txt" and folder â€œSELEX" as an example
